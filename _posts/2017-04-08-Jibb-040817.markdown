Been Relaxed too mcuh for two days by binge watching and binge eating.

<h3> Lifestyle </h3>
* 1 cup of medium roasted Guatemala Antigua by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%EC%9A%B0%EC%A2%85%ED%98%B8%EC%BB%A4%ED%94%BC%EB%B3%B6%EB%8A%94%EC%A7%91/"> Woojongho(우종호 커피) </a> french press + 1 tb coconut oil -> blend -> heavenly, flavorful, fatty coffee for morning
* Watching Masters live by <a href="https://tv.youtube.com">Youtube TV </a> ($35/month subscription with 1 month free and free chromecast given)
* Ordered <a href="https://www.getpi.co/"> Pythagoras pizza </a>, a new pizza startup in Mission that delivers to Mission and Mission Bay households. First pizza is free by promotion and you can give free pizza to your friend. My first promo code was given by my Roommate. Only available by iOS and Pepperoni Pizza is not that good. I would recommend Everything Pizza, which comes with Salsa for breadsticks.

<h3> Stock </h3>
* 2 Pharm
* 3 Fuel Cell

Will write more later about stocks.
